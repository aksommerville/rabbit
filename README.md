# Rabbit game platform

## TODO
- [x] Input.
- [ ] POC half-screen scrolling. Not really a Rabbit concern but I'm dying to see it.
- [x] Eliminate rb_framebuffer, use rb_image for everything. Think it through.
- [ ] Review blitting into alpha image. I've turned framebuffer into image broadly, but didn't look at this hard.
- [ ] Keyboard as input, connect vmgr and inmgr without a lot of drama.
- [ ] Cross-platform build scripts.
- [ ] Compile-time config file with optional unit flags, etc.
- [ ] Install scripts.
- [ ] More audio nodes.
- [ ] Default instrument set.
- [ ] Private song format? Could make it much smaller than MIDI.
- [ ] Drivers for MacOS
- [ ] Drivers for MS Windows
- [ ] Drivers for Raspberry Pi
- [ ] HTTP/WebSocket input driver -- "join in from your phone!"
- [ ] Global timing regulator
