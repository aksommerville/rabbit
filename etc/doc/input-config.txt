Rabbit Input Config Format

Text file with LF newlines (CR is safely ignored).
Line comments begin '#'.
Excess whitespace anywhere is ignored.

File is a collection of device blocks:
  device VID PID "NAME"
    RULES...
  end

RULES are any of:
  SRCBTNID btn left|right|up|down|a|b|c|d|l|r|start|select|INTEGER
  SRCBTNID axis horz|vert|-horz|-vert
  SRCBTNID hat
  
Ranges are calculated at connection, they can't be specified in the config.

Device name must not contain '#', we're not smart about tokenization.
(you can substitute '*')
