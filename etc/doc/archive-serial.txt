Rabbit Archive Format

Entire file is compressed with zlib.
We'll discuss the uncompressed content.

No global header.

Any number of records:
  vlq id delta
  vlq length
  ... content
  
A 4-byte (id delta) with all 4 high bits set (ie 0x80808080) is a type change.
That would be invalid as VLQ, so it can't be confused with a real id.
Strip the high bits from those 4 bytes, and that is the type id for all subsequent records.
Archive should begin with a type change; otherwise the initial types are zero.

All types defined by Rabbit will consist of lowercase letters, digits, or underscore.

Types:
  imag Image (PNG; maybe other format?)
  song Song (our format, not MIDI)
  snth Synth program
  grid Grid
  text Loose text
  data Unspecified binary data
